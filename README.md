# Agentic Demos

A collection of AI agent demonstrations using the OpenAI Agents framework. This repository showcases different types of AI agents working together to solve various tasks.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Agent System**: Multiple specialized agents working together
- **History Tutor Agent**: Provides assistance with historical queries and context
- **Math Tutor Agent**: Helps with mathematical problems with step-by-step explanations
- **Weather Agent**: Real-time weather information for any location worldwide
- **Triage Agent**: Intelligently routes queries to the appropriate specialist agent

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-demos.git
   cd agentic-demos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your OpenAI API key**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your OpenAI API keys:
   ```bash
   # .env.local
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   OPENAI_TRACING_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: The `.env.local` file is already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing your API keys.

## üéØ Usage

### Running the CLI Chatbot

The easiest way to interact with the AI agents is through the interactive CLI chatbot:

```bash
npm run chat
```

This starts an interactive chat session where you can ask questions about:
- **History**: Historical events, figures, and context
- **Math**: Mathematical problems with step-by-step explanations  
- **Weather**: Real-time weather information for any location

### Environment Setup

The chatbot requires environment variables to be set. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
OPENAI_TRACING_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

## üîß Dependencies

- `@openai/agents`: OpenAI Agents framework
- `axios`: HTTP client for API requests
- `zod`: TypeScript-first schema validation

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
